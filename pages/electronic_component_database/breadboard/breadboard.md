### What is a breadboard?

A breadboard is a board for prototyping circuits. It allows you to place components and test circuits easily and quickly without soldering.

Breadboard circuits are ideal for testing, but not for more final projects. For more permanent projects, you can use a protoboard or get into PCB design.
