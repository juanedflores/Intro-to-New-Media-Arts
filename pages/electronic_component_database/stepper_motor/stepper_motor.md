#### What is a Stepper Motor?

The word stepper is referring to the motor's ability to move in small rotational steps, making it possible to have high-precision position control in 360 degrees. Each step is caused by one pulse of electricity.

A common stepper motor will have 200 steps in one full rotation, making each step 1.8 degrees. It is possible to get even finer resolutions. This technique is called **Half Stepping** and **Microstepping**.

The advantage of a stepper motor versus normal DC brushed motors and servos is that they can quickly locate themselves to a known and repeatable position or interval, and then hold that position for as long as required. They are idea for short, quick moves.

The speed of rotation is directly proportional to the frequency of pulses being sent.

#### Types 

Stepper motors might have NEMA in their name, for example NEMA 17. This stands for the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) which defines a set of standards used to dictate tolerances for many products, including step motors.

Step motors are categorized by NEMA frame size, such as "size 11" or "size 23" or “size 34”. NEMA 17 stepper motors are those that have a 1.8 degree step angle (200 steps/revolution) with a 1.7 x 1.7 inch faceplate. 17 comes from the size of the faceplate in inches when divided by 10.
